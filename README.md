# Fanatec CSR Elite Pedals using Arduino

Works out of the box as plug-and-play but could be somewhat finnicky with calibrations.
Improvement to the code to include a calibration at startup would be an improvement.

Requires listed libraries:

Arduino Joystick - [Github](https://github.com/MHeironimus/ArduinoJoystickLibrary/?tab=readme-ov-file)

HX711 - [Arduino Libraries](https://docs.arduino.cc/libraries/hx711-arduino-library/)
